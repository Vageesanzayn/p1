**Task Overview: Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Tool**

During my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I was assigned to develop a Python program that implements a basic encryption algorithm. The tool enables users to encrypt or decrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher technique. The user specifies a shift value which determines the encryption or decryption transformation.

The Python program provides the following functionalities:
1. **User Interaction**: The program prompts the user to choose between encryption and decryption, or to exit the tool.
2. **Message Analysis**: Before processing, the program analyzes the input message, displaying key statistics such as the number of alphabetical letters, digits, and special characters.
3. **Invisible Input**: To ensure privacy, the message and shift value are entered invisibly using the `getpass` module.
4. **Caesar Cipher Implementation**: The program processes the input message based on the specified shift value to either encrypt or decrypt it.

This tool is designed to be user-friendly while maintaining the security and integrity of the input data. It serves as an introduction to basic cryptographic techniques and their implementation in Python.
